# Application Assets

This folder contains assets for the Satisfactory Mod Installer GUI application.

## Icon

To add a custom application icon:

1. Create or download a `.ico` file (256x256 recommended)
2. Name it `icon.ico` and place it in this folder
3. Run `build_exe.py` to build with the icon

You can use online tools like [ICO Convert](https://icoconvert.com/) to create `.ico` files from images.

### Suggested Icon Sources
